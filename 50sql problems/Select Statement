Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.
Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user

Answer:-
SELECT 
    s.user_id,
    ROUND(
        IFNULL(SUM(c.action = 'confirmed') / COUNT(c.action), 0), 
        2
    ) AS confirmation_rate
FROM 
    Signups s
LEFT JOIN

ON 
    s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY 
    s.user_id;
