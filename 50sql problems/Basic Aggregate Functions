Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

Answer:-
select * from Cinema 
where id%2!=0 and description!="boring"
order by rating desc;

| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.

Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

Answer:-
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    ROUND(COALESCE(SUM(price * units) * 1.0 / SUM(units), 0), 2) AS average_price
FROM Prices p
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold u
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY p.product_id;

+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Answer:-
select p.project_id,round(avg(e.experience_years),2) as average_years from Project p
left join Employee e
on p.employee_id=e.employee_id
group by p.project_id;


4)    Table: Users
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |

Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.
Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

Answer:-
SELECT 
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    Register r
GROUP BY 
    r.contest_id
ORDER BY 
    percentage DESC,
    r.contest_id ASC;


5)    Table: Queries
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

Answer:-
SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(1.0 * rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),   2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name;


6)    Table: Transactions
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| country       | varchar |
| state         | enum    |
| amount        | int     |
| trans_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.

Answer:-
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(*) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country;

| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.
Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Answer:-
WITH FirstOrders AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Delivery
    WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
        SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
        FROM Delivery
        GROUP BY customer_id
    )
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage
FROM FirstOrders;

| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to determine the number of players who logged in on the day immediately following their initial login, and divide it by the number of total players.

Answer:-
SELECT
  ROUND(
    SUM(
      CASE WHEN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM Activity a2
        WHERE a2.player_id = f.player_id
          AND a2.event_date = DATE_ADD(f.first_login, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
      ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    ) / COUNT(*),
    2
  ) AS fraction
FROM (
  SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
  FROM Activity
  GROUP BY player_id
) AS f;
